# Assignment 05

This assignment is completed by the students Frederik Gantriis MÃ¸ller and Marcus Henrik Simonsen.

## Exercise 5.1

See `Assignment05.fs` and `Exercises.java`.

## Exercise 5.7

See `TypedFun/TypedFun.fs`.

## Exercise 6.1

### Is the result of the third one as expected?

Yes, since the inner binding of x to 77 is never used and therefore is never passed to any function.

### Explain the result of the last one

Since `y` isn't bound to any value, it cannot compute a final value and a function is therefore returned instead of a value.
