       (None, "main", [(TypI, "n")],
        Block
          [Stmt
             (While
                (Prim2 (">", Access (AccVar "n"), CstI 0),
                 Block
                   [Stmt (Expr (Prim1 ("printi", Access (AccVar "n"))));
                    Stmt
                      (Expr
                         (Assign

                             Prim2 ("-", Access (AccVar "n"), CstI 1))))]));
           Stmt (Expr (Prim1 ("printc", CstI 10)))])]
